I switched over a really crappy DSL connection from CenturyLink yesterday, to an even worse company but with better bandwidth(The trade-offs I'm forced to make).  As a matter of curiosity and all around just being a geek. I run smokeping on my connection so I can watch the historical timeline and potentially have proof/evidence of a crappy connection if I need it.  Assuming of coarse, I could ever get someone at tech support that would be able to understand the graph... anyway.  Below is a quick recap of the decrease in latency of my internet connection from the switch over.  It also shows what streaming Netflix does to the connection on the DSL before... and the minor difference it makes after the change over(Kids have been streaming something all morning).  Anyway, I thought it was interesting, and would post for historical purposes.
