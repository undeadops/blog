### Converting My Blog from Django
I've been unhappy with the state of my blog for months, hence why I haven't updated in a very long time, and with work being a constant firefight it seems.  I've been lacking motivation to do anything tech releated when I got home.

I'm redoing the site in [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), which is a python powered static site generator.  I'm not currently planning on moving hosting off my current vps, least not for now, I will move it to my works hosting soon.  I will still need to work out some details with the site and add a few minor features here and there, as well as figure out the best gameplan for publishing.  I will get it linked up to my github or bitbucket repos eventually as well.  

more updates and getting back to consistent posts again!
